<p>"Come on, Boomer, you can do it! You can do it, old man!"</p>
<p>My daughter, Aida, is trying to help me, I'm sure, but just two
summers ago, I was learning to play Pickleball in my retirement. I was
biking, hiking and swimming. Now it's all I can do to release the brake
on my walker with my left hand. I'm working on learning to lift and not
drag my left foot. I used to be a robust, formidable and energetic
specimen of a man who did not look or act his age.</p>
<p>I liked that man. He was perhaps a little portly and more rotund then
was good for him, but he was content and secure. He knew who he was. He
carried himself with a physical confidence, and he walked with
purpose.</p>
<p>If a person cutting in front of him while he was getting on a bus, he
felt comfortable putting a hand on their shoulder and saying,"Excuse me,
you seem to be butting in, get back where you were." Then he would stare
and wait and keep his hand on the shoulder.He looked like a retired NFL
football player, he could be an intimidating presence when he needed to
be.</p>
<p>After attempting to dress to impress in his teens and failing, he
opted for blending in. His wardrobe and demeanor communicated that he
didn't care and he wasn't going to try. The truth may have been that
rejection hurt. He settled into a look: plaid shirts, the occasional
fisherman's sweater, khaki pants, and nondescript brown shoes. To dress
up he put on a cream-colored shirt, slapped on a conservative tie and
slipped into a dark sports coat.</p>
<p>He cut his hair the same way for 40 years and he wore a neat little
goatee which he trimmed into a soul patch for a few months in his early
40s. Someone told him that they didn't really like that look. It made
him look like he was trying too hard to look young. So he grew the
goatee back.</p>
<p>When his hair started to thin and he developed a little bald spot at
the back of his head, he started to obsess about what he might be able
be do to make it not seem so noticeable. But he decided that he wasn't
going to let his hair become so important to him. It was never great
hair, and it was always thin and he never invested in hairstyles, just
haircuts. So, he shaved his head.</p>
<p>When his eyesight started to go, he got round glasses and a black
leather jacket. Someone told him he looked like a man in his early
forties! Clearly, the hair had not been doing him any favors. He was
glad he decided to shave it all off. His wife told him he had a well
shaped head. That whole look, with the leather jacket and all, was very
popular in 2003. He even started to wear a subtle masculine smelling
cologne.</p>
<p>If you asked him, he would have told you that he didn't care about
style. When his daughters hit their teens and started to fuss about
hair, nails and clothes, he just rolled his eyes was thankful not to
have to work that hard to fit in or feel good about himself. He had a
sense of humor and a personality. He expected people to like him, or not
to like him. As long as enough people liked him for who he was, the rest
could go to hell.</p>
<p>The goatee turned to white and he considered dying it, but that would
be to care. He was determined not to be vain and not to pander or work
hard for approval and acceptance. He had more dignity than that. He was
active. He was fit. Head was well read. And he was comfortable in his
skin.</p>
<p>And then things went all to shit when I was 65. Here I am, in a
hospital hallway, in diapers, pushing a walker down the hall while my
daughter calls me an old man. I want to snap at her, but I don't want to
show that she's getting under my skin. Being called a boomer bothered
me, too. Of course, I was a boomer, but the word had overtones and
connotations that I did not like. So, I smiled and continued trudging to
my room.</p>
<p>After a Whipple surgery for my bile duct cancer, and chemotherapy, I
lost 70 pounds, or as the doctor put it, 32 kilos. My heart started to
beat irregularly and became enlarged. It became weak and stopped
circulating as much blood as it should. I became puffed up with excess
fluid, and my kidney function started to decline. Every morning I had to
take a handful of pills, including a diuretic to help me get rid of
excess fluid. I was so tired!</p>
<p>Then I caught covid which led to a stroke: three blood clots in the
brain. They sucked them out of my brain with a hollow tube that they
pushed through one of my arteries and into my skull, but there was
damage. Now, I can't walk without a walker. I am working very hard to
regain the use of my left hand, I have very poor balance, and all of my
muscles have atrophied and shrunk. I am unable to go to the bathroom or
wash without assistance, and I need help getting dressed and getting out
of bed.</p>
<p>Now I am definitely not comfortable in my skin. in fact, my skin
hangs like bat wings under my arms. My pectoral muscles have shrunk.
When I look in the mirror I am reminded of those Indigenous women in the
National Geographic magazines I grew up with: wizened flaps of skin,
hanging from my chest with nipples on the ends of them. My belly is gone
and has been replaced by a flappy apron of skin.</p>
<p>My face has collapsed and my cheeks are Hollow. My glasses look huge
on my face. my goatee has grown and I am unable to trim it as I usually
do because I only have the full use of my right hand. I don't recognize
myself when I look in the mirror. I look too much like my father in the
months before he died. The nurses are bringing me meal replacements
between besides and high calorie snacks to help me gain some weight.</p>
<p>Cancer blocked my bile duct, stopping the flow of bile to my
intestines to help me digest my food. I was starving. besides, I was in
so much pain, I didn't really feel like eating anyway. I feel like one
of those giant Michelin man balloons. Life just let the air out of me
and it's preparing to fold me up and put me away.</p>
<p>One night, I couldn't sleep and I realized that, even if my stroke
rehabilitation is successful, if I walk again without a walker and if I
relearn to use my left hand, the doctors have set my expectations: they
expect the cancer to come back. The surgery was unsuccessful. They left
macroscopic traces of cancer behind. Before the stroke, they told me
that, if I wanted to go on any trips, I should do it soon, but now
that's out of the question. I need a wheelchair to leave the
hospital.</p>
<p>I lay in my bed and despaired. That's it, I thought, my life is over.
I always thought it would be more pleasant to look back on than it was
right now, but maybe that's just because I'm depressed.</p>
<p>in the morning, I wake up in practice pinching my thumb and
forefinger. I lift my left foot off the bed and try to hold it there as
long as I can. I wiggle whatever fingers will move on my left hand
haphazardly and I try to flex my foot up and down as many times as I
can. Depression aside, I start the day fighting. I recite the alphabet
and repeat difficult words over and over again to improve my speech. I
swallow sips of thickened water and pay attention to the swallowing
action so that it can become easier.</p>
<p>later, I attend appointments with a physiotherapist, who puts me on a
sort of exercise bike at a low setting for as long as I can pedal. At
first I could do it for 5 minutes, but now I'm trying to make it to
10.</p>
<p>Then, we do some strengthening exercises that leave me Breathless. my
hands tremble. a nurse comes to get me and wheels me back to my room
and, when he pours me back into bed, I feel like a marionette after
someone has cut the strings. I am so terribly weak, unable to assist
very much at all.</p>
